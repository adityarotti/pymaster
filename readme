Dependencies for compiling: Lapack, f2py (usually comes with numpy)
Dependencies for running the python notebook: jupyter notebook, healpy

Follow these steps:
 - cd modules
 - Make appropriate edits to the Makefile. (set fortran compiler)
 - Run the make file, if successful, it should create a file named master.so
 - On successfully generating master.so run: cd ../
 - You should be able to run the python notebook: Running_master.ipynb.

Note: 
1. Open the PDF file Running_master.pdf to check how the python notebook is supposed to look after successfully running it. 
2. All the necessary data file (mask, power spectrum) are included with the package.
3. Right now these codes work with temperature like maps. The fortran program master.f90 does have a subroutine to work with the maps returned by the masked QU2EB pipeline, however it is not integrated with the implementation of the master routines made available here.
